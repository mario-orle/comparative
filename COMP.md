## Recommendations

- **Source Code Hosting:** GitHub is the standard for most teams, with great integrations and a robust paid offering. For small teams, GitHub is also the easiest and most cost-effective option.
- **CI/CD & Deployment:** Vercel is highly recommended for React (and especially Next.js) apps due to its seamless integration, preview deployments, and developer experience. For small projects, Vercel's simplicity and automatic previews are ideal.
- **Database:** Supabase offers a modern, open-source Postgres solution with built-in auth and storage. It's especially easy and cost-effective for small projects.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is easy if you use Supabase; Auth0 and Clerk are good for more advanced needs. For small apps, Supabase Auth is the simplest choice.
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage is recommended for most apps using Supabase; S3 is best for large-scale or enterprise needs. For small projects, Supabase Storage is the easiest to set up.
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Sentry is highly recommended for error monitoring. Use Vercel Analytics for simple, privacy-friendly metrics if deploying on Vercel. Google Analytics is best for marketing and traffic analysis. For small projects, Sentry's free tier is usually sufficient.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** BrowserStack is the most robust and popular choice, but CrossBrowserTesting is a solid alternative for manual and automated cross-browser QA, especially for small teams.
- **Task Management:** Jira is best for large or dev-heavy teams, Monday.com is great for mixed or business-oriented teams, and Trello is ideal for small or fast-moving teams.
- **Developer AI Assistants & Coding Tools:** GitHub Copilot is the best all-around choice for most developers. Cursor is excellent for codebase navigation and chat-based help. Tabnine is a good privacy-focused alternative.

**Summary:**
> For a small React project, a stack of GitHub + Vercel + Supabase (DB/Auth/Storage) + Sentry + CrossBrowserTesting + Trello + GitHub Copilot (or Cursor) offers a simple, low-friction, and scalable foundation.

**Overall, for a modern React app, a stack of GitHub + Vercel + Supabase + Sentry + BrowserStack (or CrossBrowserTesting) + Jira (or Monday.com/Trello) + GitHub Copilot (or Cursor/Tabnine) is a robust, developer-friendly, and scalable choice.**
